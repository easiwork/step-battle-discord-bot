### Step 2: Add Volume Service (for Database Persistence)

```bash
# Discord Bot Configuration
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_actual_discord_bot_token
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_discord_client_id

# Webhook Configuration
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secure_webhook_secret_key
PORT=8080

# Database Configuration (Railway Volume)
DATABASE_PATH=/data/step-battle.db
```

### Step 4: Configure Volume Mount

1. In your main service settings, go to "Settings" tab
2. Under "Volumes", add a new volume mount:
   - **Volume**: `database-volume`
   - **Mount Path**: `/data`

### Step 5: Deploy

1. Railway will automatically deploy when you push to your main branch
2. Or click "Deploy" in the Railway dashboard
3. Monitor the deployment logs for any issues

## ðŸ”— Update Discord Webhook URL

Once deployed, Railway will provide a public URL like:
```
https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

Update your Apple Shortcuts to use:
```
https://your-app-name.railway.app/webhook
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Health Check
Railway will automatically monitor the health endpoint:
```
https://your-app-name.railway.app/health
```

### Logs
- View real-time logs in Railway dashboard
- Monitor bot activity and webhook requests
- Check for any errors or issues

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Bot not starting**
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify Discord token and client ID
- Check deployment logs for errors

**2. Database not persisting**
- Ensure volume is properly mounted to `/data`
- Check `DATABASE_PATH` is set to `/data/step-battle.db`

**3. Webhook not working**
- Verify `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set correctly
- Check `PORT` environment variable is set to 8080
- Check the webhook URL is updated in Apple Shortcuts
- Monitor webhook logs in Railway dashboard

**4. Bot commands not working**
- Ensure bot has proper Discord permissions
- Check if bot is online in Discord
- Verify slash commands are registered

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Check Railway CLI (if installed)
railway status

- **Volume Storage**: Small cost for persistent storage
- **Bandwidth**: Minimal for Discord bot usage
